Hi, I'm Tsin. I've been working at **Tencent** for 6+ years. Now, I'm a senior rendering engineer at **NEXT** Studios. Prior to join game studios, I used to work on mobile application development (**QQ** Android dev).

This place is my home page for my spare time projects. Following are two open-source projects of mine that I worked on before,

- [kaleido3d](https://github.com/DsoTsin/kaleido3d), a cross-platform renderer
- [IrisBuild](https://github.com/kaleido3d/IrisBuild/), a cross-platform build system for kaleido3d.

To those who wants to connect, for whatever reason, please contact me through the following media,
