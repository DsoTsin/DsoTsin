Hi, I'm Tsin. This place is my home page for my spare time projects. Following are two open-source projects of mine that I worked on before,

- [kaleido3d](https://github.com/DsoTsin/kaleido3d), a cross-platform renderer intended to become infrastructure for Metaverse Development.
- [IrisBuild](https://github.com/kaleido3d/IrisBuild/), a cross-platform build system for kaleido3d.

To those who wants to connect, for whatever reason, please contact me through the following media,
